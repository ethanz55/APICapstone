# Never Starvin'

This is my API Hack capstone Project for Thinkful.
It is a restaurant locator to find restaurants in your
city. Made with the [Zomato's](https://developers.zomato.com/) 
['/geocode'](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/common/geocode) and
['/restaurant'](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/restaurant/restaurant_0) APIs.

## Important Note

The images are preset because Zomato requires a partnership with them
in order to access their photos. The phone number also requires a partnership
or else both features would have been implemented into the project.
